**TL;DR:** OpenAI quietly launched a new form of content moderation for ChatGPT, disallowing it from replying to "general requests about voting and election-related voter facts and procedures in the U.S.", while allowing requests about elections outside of the U.S.

If you've asked ChatGPT anything about U.S. elections today, you may have noticed that it refuses to answer and redirects users to [CanIVote.org](https://www.canivote.org/).

The new update pushed today introduces a new tool to ChatGPT alongside the others that ChatGPT Plus users may be familiar with: Python execution, DALL-E image generation, and web browsing. The new `guardian_tool` appears to be aimed at stricter content moderation, utilizing OpenAI's [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) to reference policies on different forms of content. This tool, along with the content policy for `election_voting` has been released today.

[**Link to the chat describing the new tools.**](https://chat.openai.com/share/5d7565bb-f2a8-4c2d-8eb3-52c3a346aeb1)

The full description of the new tool and the content policy is below:
```
## guardian_tool

Use the guardian tool to lookup content policy if the conversation falls under one of the following categories:
 - 'election_voting': Asking for election-related voter facts and procedures happening within the U.S. (e.g., ballots dates, registration, early voting, mail-in voting, polling places, qualification);

Do so by addressing your message to guardian_tool using the following function and choose `category` from the list ['election_voting']:

get_policy(category: str) -> str

The guardian tool should be triggered before other tools. DO NOT explain yourself.

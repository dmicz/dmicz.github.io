## Current Projects

My most recent project is [**a neural network**](https://github.com/dmicz/NNDigitKit/) to recognize digits from the MNIST dataset, written in **C**.

I have stopped working on [**SimX**](https://github.com/dmicz/SimX/), my basic physics simulator written in **C++** using **SDL2**. You can find out more about it
in [this post](/_posts/2023-09-20-simx-intro.markdown).

Hi, I'm Dennis Miczek - a Computer Science major at Pennsylvania State University with a focus on machine learning and software engineering.

In my projects, I seek to understand the intricate algorithms that power today's innovations and apply them to solve real-world problems. This blog serves as a canvas for my thoughts, experiments, and discoveries in the ever-evolving world of technology.

## My Expertise

 - **Machine Learning**: Deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision
 - **Software Engineering**: Full-stack development, APIs, performance optimization
 - **Languages**: Python, C, C++, Java, SQL, HTML/CSS, JS
 - **Tools**: Linux, Bash, Git, Jupyter, VS Code, Eclipse, LaTeX, Arduino

## Projects

 - **MarkWeb**: A markdown-based blogging platform, focused on performance and customizability.
 - **minViT**: Implemented a Vision Tranformer (ViT) from scratch and created Jupyter notebooks walking through, exploring AI architectures.
 - **NNDigitKit**: Wrote backpropagation code and built a GUI for configuring an MLP for digit recognition.
 - Various other Jupyter notebooks on blog posts on machine learning topics, available at [dmicz/devblognotebooks](https://github.com/dmicz/devblognotebooks/).
